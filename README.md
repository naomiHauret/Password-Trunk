# Password-Trunk
A little software I designed in Java this summer to practice my coding and learn how to use JTable.

I designed it for my parents so they have a place to store their passwords easily.

The user enters the name of the website/application, his/her login and his/her password. The application store it in a file.

THIS IS NOT SECURE AT ALL. The file is not hidden and anyone who launches the application can have an access to the logins and passwords.

This application only allows ONE user (or plenty if you don't mind people knowing your passwords and logins)
